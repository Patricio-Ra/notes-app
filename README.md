# Notes app.
  Very simple front-end app that uses `localStorage` for saving text notes that contains a title and a body to be set by the user.
  Notes can be updated and removed. The data is visible in various tabs/devices in real time.
  Notes uses an ID for tracking them and timestamp to show the updatedAt and createdAt information.
  It has a filter and a sort method that uses timestamps.
  The design and CSS is very basic since it's not the goal of this project.
